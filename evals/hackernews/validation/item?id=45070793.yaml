  \ (implying that they have the same average exit exam scores) as those who entered\
  \ with a 9.5? That can&#x27;t possibly be true.<p>ETA: I also thought the conclusion\
  \ -- that other countries should adopt a similar education model -- was out of step\
  \ with most of the body text, which seemed to stress the downsides for weaker students.\
  \ (There&#x27;s no actual contradiction here, and perhaps the claim about most of\

  >&gt; That can&#x27;t possibly be true<p>It tracks with spatial inequality.<p>A\

  \ have historically been clustered in the capital and a couple regional cities.<p>The\

  >Tl;dr - Romania, like other Eastern European states, uses &quot;tracking&quot;\
  \ or separate educational streams, so students from &quot;National Colleges&quot;\
  \ (the top tier of Romanian high schools) tend to be overrepresented.<p>&gt; The\
  \ design of Romania\u2019s educational system makes it perhaps the most stratified\
  \ educational system in the world<p>&gt; One of the cruel parts of the Romanian\
  \ system is that, though sorting is nationally available, students do not have equal\
  \ opportunities to sort. Students located in smaller towns have fewer high school\
  \ options to select from unless they\u2019re among the few who opt into a military\
  \ academy, which means joining the military<p>&gt; This combined sorting between\
  \ schools and tracks means that low-ability students get stuck with other low-ability\
  \ students, and high-ability students are surrounded by other high-ability students.\
  \ In effect, peer groups throughout high school are extremely homogeneous.<p>----------<p>While\
  \ this is good for identifying talent for Olympiads, it&#x27;s questionable whether\
  \ this is a net benefit for Romania as a whole. Neighboring Poland doesn&#x27;t\
  \ have the same level of tracking in it&#x27;s educational system and has much stronger\
  \ human capital based on HDI compared to Romania, despite both being roughly comparable\
  \ to each other in the 1990s.<p>Human capital isn&#x27;t developed by having a minority\
  \ of students becoming the cream of the crop, it comes by helping all students get\
  \ the option or ability to rise to the academic level at which they can succeed\
  \ irrespective of geographic location (small town vs city), ethnicity, or economic\
  \ class.<p>Ik people tend to point to Russian, Chinese, and Indian Olympiad students\
  \ as being examples of success, but most of them also attended top universities\
  \ due to their Olympiad attendance, so I doubt the Olympiad itself had an impact\
  \ compared to attending a Tsinghua, FyzTech (Citadel still hires from there for\
  \ the London office at least circa 2023 despite the war in Ukraine and sanctions\
  \ on Russia), or IIT Delhi.<p>And anecdotally at least, I went to HS and college\
  \ with a decent number of national and international Olympiad winners (one of whom\
  \ was both a IMO and IPhO team member concurrently), and while they did decent in\
  \ life (some HFT, mostly academia) it wasn&#x27;t much different of an outcome compared\
  \ to our peers who didn&#x27;t partake in those olympiads.<p>This shouldn&#x27;t\
  \ dissuade people from doing Olympiads if they wish, but targeting Olympiad success\
  \ for the sake of Olympiad success seems toxic and a waste of resources.<p>Edit:\
  \ cannot reply<p>&gt; Cyberax<p>I am not opposed to students participating in Olympiads\
  \ od they chose so with full autonomy and independence, just like I am not opposed\
  \ to students who want to do well in sports because they like sports.<p>If you are\
  \ forcing your kid to be a tier 1 quarterback OR a IMO participant, you aren&#x27;t\
  \ making them a well rounded student.<p>And if you as a society make &quot;being\
  \ a football player&quot; or &quot;being a topper&quot; the primary goal, you aren&#x27;t\
  \ actually identifying new talent, because the only way to rise to the top in a\
  \ field is if you have an actual aptitude AND interest.<p>There&#x27;s a reason\
  \ why China and India are seeing significant social opposition from younger generations\
  \ about &quot;test driven&quot; and &quot;rote&quot; culture, the same way plenty\
  \ of boomer nerds on HN who grew up in the 80s and 90s were probably ostracized\
  \ for not being into football (idk - I wasn&#x27;t around for much of the 90s, I&#x27;m\
  \ subsisting of pop culture from that era like Daria)</div><div class=\"reply\"\

  <div class=\"comment\"><div class=\"commtext c00\">The issue with &quot;gifted only\
  \ schools&quot; is they end up eating the bulk of funds and legitimately don&#x27;t\
  \ have a strong predictive capacity on student success that couldn&#x27;t already\
  \ be explained the parental background and early childhood care.<p>In my case, I\
  \ never placed in gifted academic programs in elementary and middle, but by HS was\
  \ able to take 14 AP classes (and auto shop - always liked tinkering since elementary\
  \ school; which was a major reason why I never placed well in gifted programs) and\
  \ end up at HYS. Most of my peers there similarly didn&#x27;t attended gifted programs\
  \ or high schools - amongst the non-legacies the biggest predictor of success was\
  \ SAT scores and GPA.<p>While giving and funding academic and gifted tracks within\
  \ schools should be allowed, &quot;gifted&quot; students should not be segregated\
  \ from &quot;normal&quot; students. There&#x27;s no reason a high school can&#x27;t\
  \ both offer as many AP classes as possible ALONG with vocational classes.<p>Edit:\
  \ can&#x27;t reply<p>&gt; Why should gifted schools need more money than normal\
  \ schools<p>It&#x27;s not that they need more funding. The issue is gifted programs\
  \ tend to overlap with upper income families [0] - the same kinds of families that\
  \ are overrepresented in School Boards and PTAs [1]<p>I&#x27;m not saying go all\
  \ &quot;San Francisco 2.0&quot;, but recognize that gifted only schools does lead\
  \ to a moral perception that other students are not as deserving for funding or\
  \ are &quot;bad students&quot;.<p>[0] - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.vanderbilt.edu&#x2F;2019&#x2F;09&#x2F;30&#x2F;socioeconomic-status-dictates-which-children-get-into-gifted-programs&#x2F;\"\

    Why Romania excels in international Olympiads I would like to point out for context that the author, Jordan Lasker, is a eugenist derided for shoddy science, falsely using university affiliations, and racist commentary. I do not write this to contradict particular claims in the article above, but @cremieux should be read cautiously. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Lasker There are many factors - most of them economic and cultural - but it all starts with an intense maths syllabus in school, Soviet Union style. Here's the current one for 5th to 8th grade: https://www.scribd.com/document/184259748/The-Romanian-Maths... Most kids are overwhelmed by the complexity and volume (homework is brutal) but those few with an aptitude for it thrive and are picked up quickly by teachers looking to mentor them further for local, national and international contests. The education system is stratified, keeping high-achieving students together, promoting them to schools with good teachers, etc. OK, so then why don't the situations given in the elaborate description then show up in the statistics, like the "fat right tail" that isn't there? It's because the students sent to olympiads are statistical outliers, too few in number to skew statistics. The system acts to identify and foster them, but to the detriment of national averages. I wonder if national averages actually matter very much beyond being a vanity statistic? While it's good to have a generally more mathematically capable population, you would expect most actual "progress" (papers, discoveries, things built) to be made by the outliers. I guess there's another layer tho where in 2025, assuming they are rational, you wouldn't necessarily expect their efforts to benefit Romania. Yes, a numerate population as assessed by national averages matters. A more numerate population reasons better about economic policies and may vote more wisely. Numeracy is closely tied to the ability to work in a variety of occupations. If we consider probability and statistics, the implications are especially salient. This is a very interesting topic and the article seems quite thorough. But I have trouble interpreting the crucial "School and track sorting can bolster or bust academic achievement" plots: The y axis is labelled "Graduation score percentile", but it has negative numbers on the scale. How are these values being corrected? The series for 1-school towns on the left plot is basically flat; am I supposed to believe that, in such towns, students entering the school with a 0.5 on the high school admission test appear at the same exit exam percentile (implying that they have the same average exit exam scores) as those who entered with a 9.5? That can't possibly be true. ETA: I also thought the conclusion -- that other countries should adopt a similar education model -- was out of step with most of the body text, which seemed to stress the downsides for weaker students. (There's no actual contradiction here, and perhaps the claim about most of society's advances being due to the top-end achievers was intended to justify this angle, but I was nevertheless surprised that there wasn't much discussion of why this upside should overpower the concerns for weaker students.) > That can't possibly be true It tracks with spatial inequality. A 1 school town is highly likely to be a small rural town with limited economic prospects. Like plenty of CEE countries, the overwhelming majority of opportunities have historically been clustered in the capital and a couple regional cities. The kind of town or village with only a single school is going to have fewer social benefits or services compared to an urban school. Basically, what it is saying is students in those kinds of towns are s** out of luck statistically speaking compared to their urban peers. There's a reason Romania's HDI has remained lower than Russia's until recently thanks to EU funding to help develop Romania (which is now on track to become a major economic pole in the CEE) Edit: can't > A lot turns on this. (I suppose I could read the underlying paper, but I'm lazy.) I recommend checking it out. It explains the methodology and some potential wonkiness. It's always good to read the docs I acknowledge that effect is present, but it's simply not strong enough to dominate natural variation in ability (for which high school entrance exam scores are a proxy) to the point where the results are completely flat -- in fact, students who achieved the highest scores on the entrance exam were slightly lower in exit scores on average than those with low or medium entrance scores! What this tells me is that some kind of correction is being applied to those y values (we already know this because of negatives numbers on a "percentile" axis) -- but what? A lot turns on this. (I suppose I could read the underlying paper, but I'm lazy.) A better question is: "Why should country X perform well in international Olympiads"? It is just entertainment. It doesn't have any meaningful, deep or relevant impact on culture and quality of life of a country. At best it boost narcissistic jingoism and nationalism. Life in a country won't get any better because someone that carries their flag appeared on television winning a medal. This is just a globalized version of the Roman "panis et circensis", but without the panis. Well, you set up a system that fosters competition, you get excellence as a result. DUH. Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus also have similar systems, and they punch way above their weight in math and CS: https://www.imo-official.org/country_team_r.aspx?code=RUS https://www.imo-official.org/country_team_r.aspx?code=UKR https://www.imo-official.org/country_team_r.aspx?code=BLR Ironically, the US schools do have tracking. For athletics. The US absolutely _needs_ to have a school system that challenges students. No more nonsense about racist algebra. IMHO there should be challenges but also opportunities for self correction and movement. The problem with test score stratification is that you start treating kids as unchanging objects being measured by an infallible yardstick, when neither assumption is true. It's not racism it's essentialism and poor education. An ideal educational system would tailor material and projects to an individual student and adjust at the rate they improve. You get excellence in a tiny number of individuals who don't budge the statistics. The national averages are poor, and the excelling individuals are not even numerous enough to create a "fat right tail". This is interesting if true, but without data I can't take this claim at face value. "When a metric becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure" is known as Goodhart's Law The parent is arguing for a target, not for a metric, so Goodhart's Law doesn't apply here. This is a BS saying because it's so easy to find counterexamples. Let's try to use the number of child deaths, for example. By your saying, trying to do that is bad. Because governments probably will somehow resurrect dead children to look good at this metric. Right? Look at what France, Japan, and USA consider childhood deaths. Back when I did medical software and wrote reports, France and Japan both lumped at lot of deaths post birth into 'death at birth' to lower their childhood death statistics. No, but it is easy to see how reporting the death of children could be withheld - say for instance, if this metric had penalties associated with it. Tl;dr - Romania, like other Eastern European states, uses "tracking" or separate educational streams, so students from "National Colleges" (the top tier of Romanian high schools) tend to be overrepresented. > The design of Romania’s educational system makes it perhaps the most stratified educational system in the world > One of the cruel parts of the Romanian system is that, though sorting is nationally available, students do not have equal opportunities to sort. Students located in smaller towns have fewer high school options to select from unless they’re among the few who opt into a military academy, which means joining the military > This combined sorting between schools and tracks means that low-ability students get stuck with other low-ability students, and high-ability students are surrounded by other high-ability students. In effect, peer groups throughout high school are extremely homogeneous. ---------- While this is good for identifying talent for Olympiads, it's questionable whether this is a net benefit for Romania as a whole. Neighboring Poland doesn't have the same level of tracking in it's educational system and has much stronger human capital based on HDI compared to Romania, despite both being roughly comparable to each other in the 1990s. Human capital isn't developed by having a minority of students becoming the cream of the crop, it comes by helping all students get the option or ability to rise to the academic level at which they can succeed irrespective of geographic location (small town vs city), ethnicity, or economic class. Ik people tend to point to Russian, Chinese, and Indian Olympiad students as being examples of success, but most of them also attended top universities due to their Olympiad attendance, so I doubt the Olympiad itself had an impact compared to attending a Tsinghua, FyzTech (Citadel still hires from there for the London office at least circa 2023 despite the war in Ukraine and sanctions on Russia), or IIT Delhi. And anecdotally at least, I went to HS and college with a decent number of national and international Olympiad winners (one of whom was both a IMO and IPhO team member concurrently), and while they did decent in life (some HFT, mostly academia) it wasn't much different of an outcome compared to our peers who didn't partake in those olympiads. This shouldn't dissuade people from doing Olympiads if they wish, but targeting Olympiad success for the sake of Olympiad success seems toxic and a waste of resources. Edit: cannot > Cyberax I am not opposed to students participating in Olympiads od they chose so with full autonomy and independence, just like I am not opposed to students who want to do well in sports because they like sports. If you are forcing your kid to be a tier 1 quarterback OR a IMO participant, you aren't making them a well rounded student. And if you as a society make "being a football player" or "being a topper" the primary goal, you aren't actually identifying new talent, because the only way to rise to the top in a field is if you have an actual aptitude AND interest. There's a reason why China and India are seeing significant social opposition from younger generations about "test driven" and "rote" culture, the same way plenty of boomer nerds on HN who grew up in the 80s and 90s were probably ostracized for not being into football (idk - I wasn't around for much of the 90s, I'm subsisting of pop culture from that era like Daria) I don’t necessarily see a problem with enabling like talented groups to be mingled together, that said it depends on the metrics. A friend who had a 3.2 in HS did way better in life than several 4.0+ students. The other end of the spectrum is the way most of the US handles high school. Long gone are gifted and talented programs before high school and in many cases, for instance those with an ability for math are stuck in classes with those that will top out before algebra. I understand your point, but the catering to the mediocre that happens these days in US grade schools isn’t the right answer either. The issue with "gifted only schools" is they end up eating the bulk of funds and legitimately don't have a strong predictive capacity on student success that couldn't already be explained the parental background and early childhood care. In my case, I never placed in gifted academic programs in elementary and middle, but by HS was able to take 14 AP classes (and auto shop - always liked tinkering since elementary school; which was a major reason why I never placed well in gifted programs) and end up at HYS. Most of my peers there similarly didn't attended gifted programs or high schools - amongst the non-legacies the biggest predictor of success was SAT scores and GPA. While giving and funding academic and gifted tracks within schools should be allowed, "gifted" students should not be segregated from "normal" students. There's no reason a high school can't both offer as many AP classes as possible ALONG with vocational classes. Edit: can't > Why should gifted schools need more money than normal schools It's not that they need more funding. The issue is gifted programs tend to overlap with upper income families [0] - the same kinds of families that are overrepresented in School Boards and PTAs [1] I'm not saying go all "San Francisco 2.0", but recognize that gifted only schools does lead to a moral perception that other students are not as deserving for funding or are "bad students".

Students in rural and small town schools are less liked to be as healthy or a affluent as students in cities or major urban centers, and this does have a tangible downstream effect on education as a whole. [2] - https://www.shs-conferences.org/articles/shsconf/abs/2021/06... > If you look at SF... Note how I said << I'm not saying go all "San Francisco 2.0" >> There is a happy middle ground between being an exclusionary system like Romania's or a delusional bussed system like San Francisco. Giving the example of a city with a population the size of Cincinnati is clearly a facile argument, as it is obviously not representative of the rest of California, let alone the US. That is a lot to read. I’m no longer in my 40s. Grade school - in San Jose - gifted and talented classes were classes at the school not a separate school. Sadly education has evolved where schools teach to the norm rather than acknowledging people have different strengths and weaknesses. It does not require separate schools, it needs funding and more importantly, someone good at math needs to be able to work with others good at math. The educational curriculum in the US for grade school has been standardized to the mediocre and any attempt to encourage gifted is considered a problem. Why should gifted schools need more money than normal schools? I would imagine "problematic children schools" would need the most funds because you would need the lowest teacher:student ratio to maintain order > The issue with "gifted only schools" is they end up eating the bulk of funds No, they don't. If you look at SF, the high-performing Lowell High gets a bit _less_ funding than the average for the district. Stuyvesant in NYC is right at the average spending. I studied in a magnet school with other gifted kids, including a future Olympiad winner. Our school barely had heating in winter. It's really the _other_ kids that make all the difference. >The issue with "gifted only schools" is they end up eating the bulk of funds The article points out that the opposite is the case in Romania: the highest-ability schools receive a decrement in funding. > Neighboring Poland they aren't neighbors. What's HDI ? > they aren't neighbors Lviv will always be Lwow in my heart /s Yep, but the distance between both isn't significant both physically and culturally. > What's HDI Human Development Index - it's a composite index that combines health, education, and economic indicators in a quick benchmark to compare relatively human capital development. > Ik people tend to point to Russian, Chinese, and Indian Olympiad students as being examples of success, but most of them also attended top universities due to their Olympiad attendance, so I doubt the Olympiad itself had an impact compared to attending a Tsinghua, FyzTech (Citadel still hires from there for the London office at least circa 2023 despite the war in Ukraine and sanctions on Russia), or IIT Delhi. First, if you remove the Olympiad-based admission, there's no guarantee that these students could _get_ into the top-level universities. Second, people in the US _love_ to point out that athletics "builds the character" and sets people up for success later in life. Well, do you think that training for Olympiads and competing in high-stakes academic tournaments also does nothing? reply
